        <h1><b> An adventure travel story: The Lost City of Z by David Grann</b>
            <h2>
                <h2><b>

                        The story tells of an expedition into the Amazon to find signs of an explorer who disappeared in
                        the rainforest in the 1920s. But this expedition has a few interesting twists and turns in it,
                        too. Put on your best safari hat, settle down on the couch and get ready for an adventure. This
                        one’s a long one, so bookmark it for a long and laid-back evening in.
                    </b></h2>

                    <h1> A short travel story for foodies:<br> <b></b>In a Minivan With a Stranger by Michael
                        Chabon</h1><br>
                    <h2> Perhaps you’re thinking of that roadtrip with your best friend. The one where you ran out of
                        petrol in a completely deserted area and had to walk several miles to the nearest fuel station
                        where you were rewarded for your efforts with a jerry can of petrol, an ice cream and a lift
                        back to the car. Maybe you’re thinking of the day you lost your wallet in New York City; just as
                        panic began to fill your lungs and well up in your eyes, someone tapped you on the shoulder and
                        handed it back to you with a smile.

        <h1> Another short travel story for foodies: Long Day’s Journey by Elizabeth Gilbert</h1><br>
        <h2>Join Elizabeth and her companion on a walking and eating tour through Provence in this stunning story.
            Foodies the world over will revel in her mouthwatering descriptions of French delicacies, including
            delightfully strong cheeses, crisp and delicious wines and flaky, buttery pastries.

            Laced with her characteristic humour and imbued with a healthy dose of self-deprecation, this is everything
            you need to get out of your living room and into the French countryside (metaphorically, of course).
            Needless to say, by the end of this story, your mouth will be watering and you’ll probably have another trip
            on your bucket list.

        <h1> A funny travel story: Do We Transcend Before or After We Purchase the Commemorative Eel Cakes?</h1><br>

        <h2> Feel like your living room walls are closing in on you? Escape to the mountains with this hilarious tale
            about
            preparing to climb Japan’s Mount Fuji and an actual climb up the famous mountain.

            Guaranteed to distract you, at least temporarily, from your quarantined status, this story is fun, silly and
            refreshingly real. Get ready to rejoice in the narrator’s moments of triumph, sigh in her moments of
            disappointment and guffaw at her many funny interactions.</h2>

            A sci-fi travel short story: Any Way the Wind Blows by Seanan McGuire </h1><br>

        <h2>If you’re not only sick and tired of your living room but also of the fierce current of negative news about
            the coronavirus and its impact, how about another world entirely? This is one of those sci-fi short travel
            stories that requires all your imagination, and thus your undivided attention (no room for thoughts of
            COVID-19 now!).

            Captain Isabelle Langford and her crew are on a mission that requires travelling through parallel worlds,
            and they’ve just stumbled on a human-occupied Manhattan. With multi-headed navigators and carnivorous
            pigeons, this is one travel story you’ll thankfully never have to live through yourself – but will probably
            really enjoy reading about. </h2>
